* **Project Members:**
  * Bruno Aguiar
  * Ty Blackwell

* **Learning Goals:**
  * Create DOM elements programmatically;
  * Add elements to the DOM;
  * Update elements using innerHTML;
  * Change Properties on DOM nodes;
  * Create event listeners on DOM nodes using addEventListener();
  * Use at least 3 event listeners;
  * Manipulate the DOM;
  * Recognize JS events;
  * Communicate with the server;
  * Manipulate API data by array iteration;
  * Use JSON Communication;

These learning goals have been combined to bring you the ‘Weather Forecaster’. This Single Page Application contains an index.html, index.js, and style.css that accesses data from a public API. The SPA utilizes a .gitignore in order to hide the API key from being saved to the GitHub repository. An image file was created for the website backgrounds as well. ‘Weather Forecaster’ will allow the user to SUBMIT a 'Search by City or Zipcode' which will return the weather data for the area searched. The user will also have the ability to convert between Farenheit and Celsius for the weather data displayed using CHANGE. Lastly, the SPA offers a built in background selection option that responds via CLICK.
